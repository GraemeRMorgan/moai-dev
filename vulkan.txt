all resources - bound to command buffer resource set
    track and free once buffer is submitted

descriptor sets
    pools for each layout
    pools are fixed size (i.e. 8 or 16 per pool)
    allocate more pools as needed

SHADERS/MATERIALS specify LAYOUTS (descriptor and pipeline)
    this makes sense, since shaders ultimately consume bound resources

LAYOUTS determing pipeline creation
    this makes sense, since pipelines are specified based on layouts
    pipelines don't need to be re-created based on bindings

MOAI GFX STATE MGR can specify global address slots for resources

when MOAI GFX STATE MGR resources change, a new DESCRIPTOR SET is required
    state manager grabs new DESCRIPTOR SETs on the fly
    DESCRIPTOR SETs don't specify global source addresses

UNIFORM BUFFERs need to be cached and bound with command buffers
    reallocate if changed

individual DESCRIPTORS live with resources

possible to cache DESCRIPTOR SETS (and bindings) across multiple frames
    i.e. don't reuse DESCRIPTOR SETS if their bindings haven't changed
    so for a couple of frames, there will be as many DESCRIPTOR SETS as there
        are combinations of bindings

any operations not recorded in a command buffer need a copy of the object in question
    such as DESCRIPTOR SETS

per thread POOLS?

DESCRIPTOR SET LAYOUT
    specifies resource type per index
    easy to hash

PIPELINE LAYOUT
    specified descriptor set layour per index
